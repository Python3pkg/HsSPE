HsSPE is a Haskell library for implementing SPE-style rule-based
phonologies. It is designed to be easy to extend, both in terms of
feature systems/segment definitions and in terms of rule parsers. It
includes the following components:

* Data.Phonology.Features - a library for parsing, serializing, and
  manipulating matrices of binary features (underspecification
  allowed) and for parsing IPA strings into lists of segment/feature
  matrix pairs.

* Data.Phonology.RuleParsers - a library for parsing string
  representations of phonological rules.

* Data.Phonology.Rules - a library defining phonological rules and
  functions for their application to representations.
